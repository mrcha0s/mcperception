# MC Perception

MC Perception is a function-first design system and color palette built for high-clarity dashboards, trading interfaces, and internal data-dense tools. It follows the principle of **form follows function**, prioritizing readability, precision, and performance over ornamentation.

Although visually minimal — even intentionally “ugly” by aesthetic standards — every decision is correct, calculated, and optimized for fast comprehension under real-world conditions.

## Philosophy

MC Perception is built around functional clarity. Every color, ratio, and component is intentionally designed to:

- reduce cognitive load  
- increase scan speed  
- emphasize information hierarchy  
- aid high-pressure decision-making  

It rejects aesthetic noise and focuses on correctness and comprehension — especially in trading and monitoring environments where readability matters more than visual branding.
